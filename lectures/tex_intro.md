In the spring of 2023 I lectured Advanced Integrated Circuits for the second
time. I have an inherent need to make things better, and the course is no
different.

In the first round I noticed that very little of what I had on slides, or
said in lectures, made it into the student brain. That annoyed me,
and I realized that probably a few things needed to change.

I needed to make the content more available, and not assume that students
actually remembered anything from previous years. I also got a suggestion from
Jonathan to flip the class room.

As a result, I
recorded a video, made the video available online, and encouraged students to ask questions in
the lectures. In the lectures I tried, to a larger degree, to explain on the white-board, and not in slides.

Sometimes I had too much material, sometimes I had too little, sometimes I went
on a tangent unrelated to the topic at hand. Sometimes I felt great after the lecture, sometimes I
felt crap.

I also learnt that even though I felt crap, there could be students that found
my crap lecture interesting (thanks JS).

It's hard to gauge whether 2023 was better than 2022, but I think so. At least I
got one student comment that the free-form white-board lectures were better than
slides (thanks J).

To prepare for the lectures, and to try and remember what to do next year, I
ended up expanding on the lecture notes, which were made available online at
[analogicus.com/aic2023](https://analogicus.com/aic2023/).

The lecture notes were partly for the students, but mostly as a love letter to my
future self.

I realized during the first years of teaching that each
`lecture` was a `race`, and each `topic` is a different `distance`. Unless I got
into perfect shape that exactly matched to the distance, then the lecture would be crap.

Next year, I hope that by reading the notes, and watching the videos,  I can shorten my training time for
each lecture to a few hours, and at the same time make the lectures better than
ever.

I love programming and automation. Not much makes me more happy than using the
same source (the [slide
markdowns](https://github.com/wulffern/aic2023/tree/main/lectures)), to generate the [lecture notes](https://analogicus.com/aic2023/), to translate
into the [book](https://analogicus.com/aic2023/assets/aic.pdf) your looking at right now.

Thanks to Fredrik and Jonathan that helped me with the course during the 2023 semester.

That way, we use the global brain power most efficiently, and avoid multiple humans spending time on discovering the same error.
