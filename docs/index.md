I write all the lectures in markdown, and you can see the source at
[aic2023](https://github.com/wulffern/aic2023)

For the slides, I use [deckset](https://www.deckset.com) to play the slideshow.
I may also convert the slides to PDF to show them with my ipad.

I use a python script to convert the markdown slides into jekyll posts.

For some of the lectures, I'll upload an introduction video to the [AIC youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLybHXZ9FyEhZ3HT2KPzjY2bmMJupRX2M6)
