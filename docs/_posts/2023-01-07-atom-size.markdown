title: Learning the size of the Hydrogen atom

---

I enjoy learning, and right now, I'm trying to understand a bit more
on quantum mechanics. 
The source I'm using is the [Feynman Lectures of
Physics](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu), however, I like reading 
physical books, and not online.

I was reading a section on "The size of the atom", which, in my physical book, is 
chapter 2-6 in volume III, and I ran into trouble.
Let me explain the story.

## "The size of the atom" retold

Feynman's explanation in the book goes roughly like this.

We know that it's impossible to determine both position and momentum 
of an electron exactly, also known as the [Heisenberg uncertainty
principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle)

$$ \Delta x \Delta p \approx h $$

, where $\Delta x$ is the position uncertainty, $\Delta p$ is the momentum
uncertainty, and $h$ is [Planck
constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant#Reduced_Planck_constant).

Take Hydrogen with one proton and one electron. If we assume the distance from nucleus to electron is
roughly $a \approx \Delta x$  then the momentum is approximately 

$$ p \approx \frac{h}{a}$$

Feynman has a beautiful derivation. The kinetic energy is approximately 

$$ E_k = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 = \frac{p^2}{2 m} = \frac{h^2}{2 m a^2}$$

, where $m$ is the rest mass of the electron.

The potential energy is comes from the electric field between proton and
electron, and is 

$$ E_p = -\frac{q^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 a}$$

, where $\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity in vacuum, and $q$ is the charge of the electron.

As such, the total energy is 

$$ E = E_k + E_p = \frac{h^2}{2 m a^2} -\frac{q^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 a}$$

We know that the atom will settle at some $$a$$ and find some sort of energy
minimum. We can estimate the energy minimum distance $a_0$ by taking the derivative of the
energy as a function of distance and set the derivative to zero $dE/da = 0$

As a result

$$ \frac{dE}{da} = -\frac{h^2}{m a^3} + \frac{q^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 a^2 } = 0$$

Solved for $a$ we get 

$$ a_0 = \frac{h^2 4 \pi \epsilon_0}{ m q^2}$$

In the book, $a_0$ is boldy stated as 

$$ a_0 = 0.528 \times 10^{-10}\text{ meter }$$ 

## The trouble

I wanted to see if I could get the same number for $a$, so I set about inserting
for the constants[^1].

$$\epsilon_0 = \frac{1}{\mu_0 c^2}$$

, where $c$ is the speed of light, and $\mu_0$ is the permiability in vacuum, which is

$$\mu_0 = \frac{2 \alpha h}{q^2 c}$$

, where $\alpha$ is the fine structure constant.

As a result 

$$\epsilon_0 = \frac{q^2 c}{2 \alpha h c^2} = \frac{q^2 }{2 \alpha h c}$$


I inserted into the equation for $a_0$, and most of the constants canceled 

$$ a_0 = \left[h^2 4\pi \frac{q^2}{2 \alpha h c} \right]/m q^2 = \frac{2 \pi h}{\alpha m c}$$ 

When computed I got $a_0 = 2.089\times 10^{-9}\text{ meter }$

Crap, not the same as Feynman!

## Debugging

Of course, initially, I thought I must have done something wrong with the maths,
so I did the algebra multiple times, but I could not find anything
wrong.

Not trusting myself, I did a dimensional analysis. 

$h$ is Js, $m$ is  kg, $c$ is m/s, $\alpha$ is dimensionless and 
J = kg m$^2$/s$^2$

$$ \text{m} = \frac{\text{ kg m}^2/\text{s}^2 \times \text{s}}{\text{kg
}\text{m/s}} = \text{m}$$

Hmmpf, so the unit was correct. What could I have done wrong!

Next step was guessing, maybe I go the $2\pi$ wrong somehow.

Time for python coding
```python
from scipy import constants
pi = constants.pi
h = constants.physical_constants["Planck constant"][0]
alpha = constants.physical_constants["fine-structure constant"][0]
c = constants.physical_constants["speed of light in vacuum"][0]
me = constants.physical_constants["electron mass"][0]

a0f = 0.528e-10
a0 = (2*pi*1/alpha * h/c/me)
a1 = (1/alpha * h/c/me)
print("a0f = %g"%a0f)
print("a0 = %g"%a0)
print("a1 = %g"%a1)
print("a1/a0f = %g"%(a1/a0f))
```

Which gave me 
```bash
a0f = 5.28e-11
a0 = 2.08911e-09
a1 = 3.32492e-10
a1/a0f = 6.29719
````

Eureka! There is a $(1/2\pi)^2$ factor wrong!

Assuming the number from Feynman was 
correct, the equation should have been

$$ a_0 = \frac{h}{ 2 \pi \alpha m c}$$ 

I was certain I did not do the maths wrong, there was no way 
I could get right equation from where I started.

## The realization

The starting point from the book was 

![](/aic2023/assets/atomic_size.png)


, where $e^2 = q^2/4\pi\epsilon_0$, as such

$$ a = \frac{h^2 4 \pi \epsilon_0}{  m q^2}$$

Maybe there was a mistake in the book? If there was a typo, and it should have been

$$ a = \frac{\hbar^2 4 \pi \epsilon_0}{  m q^2}$$

, where $\hbar = h/2\pi$, then I'd get

$$ a_0 = \left[\frac{h^2}{4\pi^2} 4\pi \frac{q^2}{2 \alpha h c} \right]/m q^2 = \frac{ h}{2 \pi\alpha m c}$$ 

and the world would make sense again. But how could I be certain?

## The confirmation

In "[The size of the
atom](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/III_02.html#Ch2-S4)", which is the
online version of the lectures the $h$ is corrected to $\hbar$. I did not do
the maths wrong, the physcial book was wrong (or inaccurate).


I'm not going to blame Feynman, and actually, I'm not going to blame anyone. The
book is written by humans, and humans will always make brain farts which lead to
errors, that's just the nature of who we are.

As you can't trust any information source 100 %, you need to have some trust in
your own ability. If you check, and check, and check, and can't find what you
did wrong, maybe the error is in the source? 

## Warning

You are also human, so even though you've check $\infty$ number of times,
there is still a finite, non-zero, probability that the error is something you
did. Don't be arrogant and always assume the error lies with others.

You can have an hypothesis that the error is with others, but you need to find supporting evidence. 

And, since we can only prove an hypothesis false, and not prove it true, we can never be 100 % certain
of anything, but we can get as close to 100 % as we want.
